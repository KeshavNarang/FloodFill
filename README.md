# FloodFill
This program contains an initially random grid of 0s and 1s that the user can flip from one state to the other. In each "turn", a cell is selected - it, and each of its horizontal and vertical neighbors with the same value, toggle as well, effectively changing an adjacent cluster of cells from one state to the other. Depth First Search in Java is used to accomplish this.
